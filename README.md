# Overview
To help Pewlett-Hackard anticipate challenges with a retiring workforce, I was asked to analyze the human resource data. The goal of this analysis had 2 major focuses. The first quesitons that needed to be answered was to determine the titles of those employees who were retiring. The second piece of the analysis was to identify those current employees who were eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This task was completed by using migrating data from CSV files into a postgres database and then writing SQL queries to analyze the datea.
